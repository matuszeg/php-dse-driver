Polygon:
  comment: |
    Encapsulates a polygon consisting of a set of linear-rings in the xy-plane.
    It corresponds to the `org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.PolygonType` column
    type in DSE.

    A linear-ring is a LineString whose last point is the same as its first
    point. The first ring specified in a polygon defines the outer edges of the
    polygon and is called the _exterior ring_. A polygon may also have _holes_
    within it, specified by other linear-rings, and those holes may contain
    linear-rings indicating _islands_. All such rings are called _interior
    rings_.

        To construct an empty Polygon:
        @code
          $polygon = new Dse\Polygon();
        @endcode
        To construct a Polygon with LineString objects:
        @code
          $exterior_ring = new Dse\LineString(new Dse\Point(0, 0), new Dse\Point(10, 0), new Dse\Point(10, 10), new Dse\Point(0, 0));
          $interior_ring = new Dse\LineString(new Dse\Point(1, 1), new Dse\Point(1, 5), new Dse\Point(5, 1), new Dse\Point(1, 1));
          $polygon = new Dse\Polygon.new($exterior_ring, $interior_ring);
        @endcode
