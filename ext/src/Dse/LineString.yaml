Dse\LineString:
  comment: |
      Encapsulates a set of lines, characterized by a sequence of {Point}s in the xy-plane. It corresponds to the
      `org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.LineStringType` column type in DSE.

          Construct a LineString with some {Point}s.
          @example Create with some points on the fly
              $p1 = new Dse\Point(2, 3);
              $p2 = new Dse\Point(4, 5);
              $lineString = new Dse\LineString($p1, $p2);
          @example Create with an array of points by unrolling into varargs
              $points = [new Dse\Point(2, 3), new Dse\Point(4, 5)];
              $lineString = new Dse\LineString(...$points);
