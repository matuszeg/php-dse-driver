Dse\Polygon:
  comment: |
      Encapsulates a polygon consisting of a set of linear-rings in the xy-plane. It corresponds to the
      `org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.PolygonType` column type in DSE.

      A linear-ring is a {LineString} whose last point is the same as its first point. The first ring specified
      in a polygon defines the outer edges of the polygon and is called the _exterior ring_. A polygon may also have
      _holes_ within it, specified by other linear-rings, and those holes may contain linear-rings indicating
      _islands_. All such rings are called _interior rings_.
