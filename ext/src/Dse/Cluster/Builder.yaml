    withHostnameResolution:
      comment: |
          Enables/Disables Hostname Resolution.

          If enabled the driver will resolve hostnames for IP addresses using
          reverse IP lookup. This is useful for authentication (Kerberos) or
          encryption SSL services that require a valid hostname for verification.
      params:
        enabled:
          comment: "True to use hostname resolution; false otherwise."

    withRandomizedContactPoints:
      comment: |
          Enable/Disables Randomized Contact Points

          If enabled this allows the driver randomly use contact points in order
          to evenly spread the load across the cluster and prevent
          hotspots/load spikes during notifications (e.g. massive schema change).

          Note: This setting should only be disabled for debugging and testing.
      params:
        enabled:
          comment: "True to enable randomized contact points; false otherwise."

    withConnectionHeartbeatInterval:
      comment: |
          Specify interval in seconds that the driver should wait before attempting
          to send heartbeat messages and control the amount of time the connection
          must be idle before sending heartbeat messages. This is useful for
          preventing intermediate network devices from dropping connections.
      params:
        interval:
          comment: "Interval in seconds (0 to disable)"
          type: int|float
