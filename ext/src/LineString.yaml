Dse\LineString:
  comment: |
    Encapsulates a set of lines, characterized by a sequence of Point's in the xy-plane. It corresponds to the
    `org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.LineStringType` column type in DSE.

        Construct a LineString with some Point's.

        To create an empty LineString:
        @code
            $lineString = new Dse\LineString();
        @endcode
        To create with some points on the fly:
        @code
            $p1 = new Dse\Point(2, 3);
            $p2 = new Dse\Point(4, 5);
            $lineString = new Dse\LineString($p1, $p2);
        @endcode
        To create with an array of points by unrolling into varargs:
        @code
            $points = [new Dse\Point(2, 3), new Dse\Point(4, 5)];
            $lineString = new Dse\LineString(...$points);
        @endcode
