# Authentication

Clients that require authentication when connecting to a secured DSE cluster
(using `com.datastax.bdp.cassandra.auth.DseAuthenticator`) should use the
following examples as reference:

* [LDAP and plain-text autentication](/features/authentication/dse/)
* [Kerberos authentication](/features/authentication/kerberos/)
